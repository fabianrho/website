I have one year of experience in web development, and I have completed one data science project. Currently, I am pursuing Master in data science at Jheronimus Academy of Data Science. I really like the idea of open science where I could contribute to developing and sharing transparent and accessible knowledge. Moreover, from my experience, I know how important it is to invest time and effort in learning new skills and tools before actually contributing to the projects. Tilburg Science Hub is a great place where you can equip yourself in necessary skills to perform research efficiently."
