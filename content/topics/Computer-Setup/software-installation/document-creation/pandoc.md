## Overview 

[Pandoc](https://www.pandoc.org/) is an extremely useful "Swiss army knife" for converting between different types of markup languages from the command line. For example, it readily builds PDFs with LaTeX and Markdown - both of which are heavily used in academic research. This guide will help you install Pandoc. To get started using it, refer to [this topic](/pandoc)!

## How to install Pandoc

### Windows

- Visit the [Pandoc installing page](https://www.pandoc.org/installing.html) and click on the blue "Download the latest installer" button. 

- Choose the file ending with `windows-x86_64.msi` to download the Windows Installer package. 
- Click on the installer in your download history. A set-up wizard will appear.
- Follow the wizard; accept the conditions and click Install. 
- Click Finish to close the setup wizard once the installation is complete. 

To make Pandoc available from the command line, we need to update our PATH settings:

- Right-click on "Computer", select "Properties" and go to "Advanced System Settings".
- Click on "Environment Variables" and find `Path` in the list of system variables.

Check if the following path is added:

```bash
;C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Pandoc
```

*For Windows 7 or 8:*
If the path is not added, and you used default settings during installation, add the following string, replacing `username` with your actual username:

```bash
;C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Pandoc
```

*For Windows 10:*

If the path is not added, click `New` and paste the following string, replacing `username` with your actual username:

```bash
C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Pandoc
```

Click OK as often as needed to save your changes.


### Mac

- Go to the [Pandoc installing page](https://www.pandoc.org/installing.html) and click on the blue "Download the latest installer" button. 
- Choose the file ending with `macOS.pkg` to download the macOS Installer package. 
- Navigate to the download folder and double-click the `.pkg` file to start the installer. 
- Follow the installation wizard, agree to the license agreement, and click Install.
- Once the installation is complete, click Close.

Alternatively, you can install Pandoc directly from the command line on a Mac device. Open a terminal window and type:

{{% codeblock %}}
```bash
brew install pandoc
```
{{% /codeblock %}}


### Linux

To install Pandoc from the command line, open a terminal window and type:

{{% codeblock %}}
```bash
sudo apt install pandoc
```
{{% /codeblock %}}


## Verify your installation

To ensure Pandoc is installed correctly, open a new terminal and type:


{{% codeblock %}}
```bash
pandoc --version
```
{{% /codeblock %}}

The output should start with the version information, such as:

```bash
pandoc 3.2

```
Make sure you have at least version 3.2 installed. 
If so, you're all set!
