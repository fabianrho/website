## Overview

This building block provides you with some practical tips for dealing with __large datasets in R__.

Many R users rely on the base R commands `read.csv` or `read.table` to import their datasets as a dataframe. Although this works well for relatively small datasets, we recommend using one of the following packages instead: the `readr`, `data.table` or the `vroom` package - simply because it is significantly faster and offers enhanced functionality.

You can obtain the data for the examples from this [link](http://download.geonames.org/export/zip/GB_full.csv.zip).

## Advantages of Using readr, data.table, or vroom Over Base R
When working with large datasets in R, the default `read.csv` method can be less efficient in terms of speed and memory usage. This is where packages like `readr`, `data.table`, and `vroom` come into play, offering a more optimized approach to data import.

### 1. Significant Speed Gains
Efficiency is important when processing large datasets in R. Traditional base R methods, while reliable, do not offer the speed necessary for modern data analysis tasks. This is where `readr`, `data.table`, and `vroom` shine, each providing solutions to significantly reduce data loading times.

#### Practical Impact
Benchmarking reveal that all three packages significantly outperform the `base R` function in terms of speed. Specifically, these packages can load the dataset, with 1,809,903 rows and 12 columns, from 3 times up to 11 times faster!

```R
# Load required libraries
library(readr)
library(data.table)
library(vroom)

# Time comparisons for reading a large file
system.time(base_r <- read.delim("GB_full.txt"))
system.time(readr_data <- read_tsv("GB_full.txt"))
system.time(dt_data <- fread("GB_full.txt"))
system.time(vroom_data <- vroom("GB_full.txt", col_names = FALSE))
```

### 2. Quick Data Manipulation
The ability to efficiently manipulate data is as crucial as the import phase. All three packages `readr`, `data.table`, and `vroom` are coming shipped with  data manipulation features to improve convienence, speed and memory usage.

`Readr` Package:
- *Selective Loading*: `readr` processes the data while loaded, not after, facilitating faster manipulation.
- *Automatic Typing*: Automatically infers column types, reducing the need for post-import adjustments and speeding up the data preparation process.

`Data.table` Package:
- *In-Place Modification*: `data.table` allows for in-place data modification, avoiding the slowdowns caused by copying data.
- *Keys and Indices*: Setting keys for data indexing accelerates sorting and subsetting operations.
- *Multithreading*: Utilizes all CPU cores for parallel processing of tasks.
- *Minimal Copying*: Reduces memory usage by avoiding data duplication.

`Vroom` Package:
- _Initial Load_: Uses a quick scan to map data locations, reducing initial load times.
- _Lazy Loading_: When filtering and aggregating `vroom` only loads in the only necessary data, increasing speed performance and reducing memory footprint.
- _Capability for Large Datasets_: By querying and subsetting of datasets, avoiding full data materialization, it allows for datasets larger than the memory.

### Practical impact 
In the benchmarks, we explore different data manipulation tasks like printing, head/tail operations, random row sampling, specific row filtering, and aggregating for mean calculations.

Using the following methodology:
- _vroom_base_: Uses `vroom` for reading, then `base R` functions for manipulation.
- _vroom_dplyr_: Integrates `vroom` for reading with `dplyr` for manipulation.
- _data.table_: Employs `fread` for reading and `data.table` functions for manipulation.
- _readr_dplyr_: Uses `readr` for reading and `dplyr` for manipulation.
- _base_R_: Relies on standard `base R` functions throughout.

The table below represents the running times observed for different data manipulation packages:

### 3. Increases File Writing Performance
When it comes to writing large datasets to files, `readr`, `data.table`, and `vroom` offer increased speed performance compared to `base R`'s `write.csv()` function.

Here is our benmark test to compare these functions:

{{% codeblock %}}
```R
# creating a 1 million by 10 data frame
df <- data.frame(matrix(rnorm(1000000*10), 1000000,10))

system.time({write.csv(df, "base.csv", row.names=FALSE) }) # base R
system.time({fwrite(df, "datatable.csv") }) # data.table 
system.time({write_csv(df, "readr.csv") }) # readr
system.time({vroom_write(df, "vroom.csv")}) # vroom
```

## Practical Examples
This section walks you through practical examples using the various R packages for data importation of large datasets.

### Importing with Readr 

`read_csv()` from the `readr` package offers several advantages over the base R function `read.csv()`:
- **Integration and Type Detection**: `read_csv()` works well with other `tidyverse` packages and automatically determines the data type for each variable.
- **Tibble Output**: Unlike `read.csv()`, which produces a data.frame, `read_csv()` outputs a tibble. Tibbles offer enhanced functionality and behave more consistently when subsetting.
- **Character Variable Handling**: `read_csv()` treats text variables as character variables. 
  - In contrast, `read.csv()` automatically converts text to factors, which can be inconvenient.   
  
Overall, `read_csv()` provides a more efficient and user-friendly approach to data handling in R.

{{% codeblock %}}
```R
# import package 
library(readr)

# Import data with the readr package
df <- read_csv("YOUR_DATASET.csv")

# Import a maximum number of rows for exploratory analysis
df <- read_csv("YOUR_DATASET.csv", n_max  = 500)

# Import data that you want to use
df <- read_csv(("YOUR_DATASET.csv"), col_select = c(1, 3:4)) # column indices
df <- read_csv("YOUR_DATASET.csv", col_select = c("date","country","revenue")) # column names

# store the derivative file for future use
write_csv(df, "YOUR_CLEANED_DATASET.csv")
```
{{% /codeblock %}}

`Readr` comes with several other functions. Such as `read_csv2()` for European-friendly variant comma-separated data, `read_tsv()` for tab-separated data, `read_lines()` for line-by-line file extraction and `read.txt()` reading fixed width data.

### Importing with data.table
Switching from the `read.csv()` function to `fread()` can improve the performance of your program. It is often dubbed the "_fast and friendly file finagler_", and is efficient and straightforward to use in R. 

One of its main features is that it is designed to import data from *regularly* delimited files directly into R. Here, "regular" implies that each row in your dataset must have the same number of columns. What sets `fread()` apart is its ability to automatically detect parameters like **sep**, **colClasses**, and **nrows**, making the data import process straightforward. 

The code block below illustrates how you can import your whole dataset using `fread()` as well as subsets of it, determine the size of the resulting object, and store your new/clean versions of the data as a new file for future use.

{{% codeblock %}}
```R
# import package
library(data.table)

# import data with data.table package
df <- fread("YOUR_DATASET.csv")

# only import the first couple of rows for exploratory analysis 
df <- fread("YOUR_DATASET.csv", nrows=500)

# only import the data you actually use 
df <- fread("YOUR_DATASET.csv", select=c(1, 2, 5))  # column indices
df <- fread("YOUR_DATASET.csv", select=c("date", "country", "revenue"))  # column names

# print object size in bytes (for a quick comparison)
object.size(df)

# store the derivative file for future use
fwrite(df, "YOUR_CLEANED_DATASET.csv")
```

When starting your analysis with large datasets, start with loading a representative sample first. This practical strategy facilitates quicker fine tuning and testing of data processing and analysis scripts. If confident about hte accuarcy, and robustness of your code, scale up to the entire dataset. This approach saves time upfront and ensures a smoother workflow when handling extensive datasets.

### Importing with vroom

`Vroom` is part of `tidyverse` and is a similar to `readr::read_csv()` or `data.table::fread()`. However, when it comes to raw importing speed performance, `vroom::vroom()` often leads the pack. In the context of the dataset examined within this article, it processes data in approximately one-quarter the time taken by `data.table::fread()`.

The efficiency of `vroom` is attributed to its method of reading in files. Initially, it only marks the location of each data point, deferring from actual reading of values. Thereafter, it uses, the so-called `Altrep` framework, which creates vectors that reference these marked locations. This two-step procedure makes data acces fast and memory efficient.

Therefore the main reason `vroom` is faster is because character data is read from the file lazily; it does not read the entire dataset unless required. One major benefit is that it requires no adjustments to your data-manipulation code. However, one disadvantage to `vroom`'s lazy reading method is that it may delay the identification of potential data issues until the point of access.

Observations from benchmark results show that `vroom`'s initial read is significantly quicker than alternative methods. Routine operations such as `print()`, `head()`, and random sampling execute equally fast as the other packages. However because the character data is read lazily, operations such as filter and summarise, which need character values, require additional time. However, this cost will only occur once. After the values have been read, they will be stored in memory, and subsequent accesses will be as quick as the other packages.

{{% codeblock %}}
```R
# import package
library(vroom)

# get path to example file
input_file <- vroom_example("YOUR_DATASET.csv")
input_file

# import data with the vroom package
# Read from a path
df <- vroom(input_file)
# You can also use your path directly
df <- vroom("YOUR_DATASET.csv")

# only import the first couple of rows for exploratory analysis 
df <- vroom("YOUR_DATASET.csv", nrows=500)

# only import the data you actually use 
df <- vroom("YOUR_DATASET.csv", col_select=c(1, 2, 5))  # column indices
df <- vroom("YOUR_DATASET.csv", col_select=c(date, country, revenue))  # column names

# store the derivative file for future use
vroom_write(df, "YOUR_CLEANED_DATASET.tsv")
vroom_write(df, "YOUR_CLEANED_DATASET.csv", delim = ",")
```

Oftentimes, datasets you previously worked with remain stored in memory, even if they're no longer in use. In RStudio, click on the broom icon in the top right window to remove all objects from the environment. By removing objects which are no longer in use you will help improve RStudio's performance and reduce the risk of errors and conflicts.
